# sdl2 vs raylib

- Given the comparison between `raylib` and `SDL2` (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
  are both popular libraries in the game development and multimedia domain.
  Here's a comparison between the two libraries based on various aspects,
  specifically tailored for macOS:

| **Aspect**              | **raylib**                                                                                                                     | **SDL2**                                                                                                                                          |

| **Platforms**           | Windows, Linux, macOS, and more.                                                                                               | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and more.                                                                                                    |
| **Ease of Use**         | Known for its simplicity and straightforward API, great for beginners and prototyping.                                         | Slightly steeper learning curve than raylib but very well-documented.                                                                             |
| **Window Management**   | Provides simple functions for window creation and management.                                                                  | Comprehensive window management, input handling, and event loop capabilities.                                                                     |
| **Graphics**            | Uses a custom OpenGL wrapper, provides 2D/3D rendering functions out of the box.                                               | Primarily a 2D library, but can be combined with OpenGL for 3D rendering.                                                                         |
| **Audio**               | Built-in support for audio playback and manipulation.                                                                          | Has SDL_mixer as an additional library for audio support.                                                                                         |
| **Add-ons/Extensions**  | Not as extensive as SDL2, but covers essential game development needs.                                                         | SDL2 has many extensions (e.g., SDL_image for image loading, SDL_ttf for true type fonts, SDL_mixer for audio, and SDL_net for networking).       |
| **Community & Support** | Growing community. Active GitHub repository.                                                                                   | Large, established community. Extensive online resources, forums, and tutorials.                                                                  |
| **macOS Specifics**     | Provides native feel on macOS. macOS is a first-class citizen in raylib's supported platforms.                                 | SDL2 is well-supported on macOS and integrates well with the platform. However, some features or extensions might have nuances specific to macOS. |
| **Interoperability**    | Can be used with other C/C++ libraries, but might need additional setup for complex integrations.                              | Often used alongside other libraries (like OpenGL for 3D graphics). Highly modular and can be integrated into larger systems.                     |
| **Primary Use Cases**   | Suitable for teaching, prototyping, and small to medium-sized projects.                                                        | Suitable for a range of applications from small projects to complex games and multimedia applications.                                            |

**Conclusion**:
Both `raylib` and `SDL2` are powerful in their own right. The choice between
them depends on the specific needs of the project:

- For beginners, hobbyists, or rapid prototyping, `raylib` provides a simpler
  and more streamlined API.
- For projects that might require a broader range of features, or for
  developers who are comfortable with a slightly steeper learning curve, `SDL2`
  offers a highly modular and flexible platform with extensive community support.
  Both libraries are well-suited for macOS development, and the decision should
  be based on the project's requirements and the developer's familiarity and
  comfort with each library.
