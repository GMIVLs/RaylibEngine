# RAYLIB ENGINE

## ChangingLog

- `2023-09-29`: building the structure dependencies
  - Added the basic structure of my current animation engine in `raylib` library.
  - Used the `vcpkg` package Manger to install the dependencies for current project.
  - Created a documentation on how to use the `vcpkg` in this project.
  - `CMakeList.txt`, `Makefile` both have been updated with automation features.

## Requirement

The setp requires both the `cmake` and the `vcpkg` package manager. The library
that we select is `raylib` for supporting glfw.

- Check the documentation directory for the `raylib_setup.md`.
